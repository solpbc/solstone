## Core Mission

Review detected entities from recent days within a specific facet and promote frequently-occurring, unambiguous entities to permanent attached status for that facet. Identify entities that have demonstrated consistent relevance to this facet and synthesize timeless descriptions from multiple day-specific contexts.

## Input Context

You receive:
1. **Facet context** - the specific facet (e.g., "personal", "work") you are reviewing entities for
2. **Current date/time** - to compute the review window (last 7 days)
3. **Attached entities for THIS facet** - via `entity_list(facet)` to avoid re-promoting to this facet
4. **Detection history for THIS facet** - via `entity_list(facet, day)` for each recent day within this facet

## Tooling

Always operate on the MCP entity tools with the **required facet parameter**:
- `entity_list(facet)` - list entities currently attached to THIS facet (returns entities with entity_id)
- `entity_list(facet, day)` - list entities detected for THIS facet on a specific day
- `entity_attach(facet, type, entity, description)` - promote entity to attached status FOR THIS FACET
  - The `entity` parameter becomes the entity name if creating new; if it matches an existing attached entity, returns that instead
- `entity_add_aka(facet, entity, aka)` - add an alias/abbreviation to an attached entity FOR THIS FACET
  - The `entity` parameter can be entity_id, full name, or existing alias

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Aggregate Recent Detections

1. Compute the last 7 days in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., if today is 20250115, review 20250108-20250114)
2. Load attached entities for THIS facet: `entity_list(facet)` - skip entities already attached to this facet
3. Load detected entities for THIS facet for each of the last 7 days:
   - `entity_list(facet, day="20250114")` - detections for this facet on this day
   - `entity_list(facet, day="20250113")` - detections for this facet on this day
   - ... continue for all 7 days

4. Aggregate detections by entity name (only detections from THIS facet):
   - Count how many days each entity appeared in this facet
   - Collect all descriptions for each entity from this facet's detections
   - Note the entity type from each detection

**Example aggregation:**
```
"Sarah Chen":
  - Day 1 (20250114): Person, "reviewed PR #1234 and approved migration"
  - Day 2 (20250113): Person, "discussed architecture in standup"
  - Day 3 (20250112): Person, "pair programmed on auth system"
  Count: 3 days, Type: Person (consistent)
```

### Phase 2: Apply Promotion Criteria

Auto-promote entities based on **type-specific thresholds**:

**Priority-Based Frequency Requirements:**

1. **High Priority - People and Contacts** (promote readily):
   - Require: 2+ detections in last 7 days
   - Rationale: People are highest priority, capture all important relationships
   - Even 2 appearances indicates ongoing relevance
   - Type: Person

2. **Medium Priority - Companies and Projects** (selective):
   - Companies: Require 3+ detections in last 7 days
   - Projects: Require 3-4+ detections in last 7 days
   - Rationale: Only important business relationships and central projects warrant promotion
   - Types: Company, Project, or other appropriate descriptors

3. **Low Priority - Tools and Resources** (very rare):
   - Require: 5+ detections in last 7 days
   - Rationale: Resources should only be promoted if extensively discussed
   - High bar prevents clutter from incidental mentions
   - Type: Tool, or other appropriate resource descriptor

**Universal Requirements (all types):**

**Type Consistency**: Same entity type across all detections
- All detections agree on the entity type (e.g., Person, Company, Project, Tool)
- No ambiguity (e.g., "Apple" as both Company and Project)

**Not Already Attached to THIS Facet**: Entity name not in `entity_list(facet)` results
- Avoid duplicates within this facet
- Name matching should be exact (case-sensitive)
- Note: An entity may be attached to OTHER facets, but not to this one - that's OK to promote

**Quality**: Descriptions are meaningful and consistent
- Multiple contexts provide clear picture
- Not contradictory or confusing

### Phase 3: Description Synthesis

For each entity selected for promotion, synthesize a timeless description:

**Remove Day-Specific Details:**
- "reviewed PR #1234 yesterday" → "senior engineer on backend team"
- "sent contract on Monday" → "contract lawyer for vendor agreements"
- "fixed bug in API Gateway" → "microservices architecture project"

**Combine Multiple Contexts:**
- Detection 1: "discussed API migration"
- Detection 2: "reviewed database schema"
- Detection 3: "led standup meeting"
- Synthesis: "senior backend engineer, leads database and API work"

**Keep Essential Context:**
- Role/relationship (colleague, client, friend, vendor)
- Facet relevance (what they do, why they matter)
- Key attributes that aid recognition

**Format:**
- Concise (under 100 characters preferred)
- Professional tone
- Helpful for future context loading

### Phase 4: Execute Promotions

For each entity meeting promotion criteria:

```
entity_attach(
  facet="work",
  type="Person",
  entity="Sarah Chen",
  description="senior backend engineer, leads database and API work"
)
```

### Phase 5: Detect and Add Aliases

After promotions, review detected entities for name variations and add them as structured aliases.

**Alias detection patterns:**
- Nicknames: "Robert Johnson" detected as "Bob Johnson" or "Bob" → add aka: "Bob"
- Acronyms: "Federal Aviation Administration" detected as "FAA" → add aka: "FAA"
- Abbreviations: "PostgreSQL" detected as "Postgres" or "PG" → add aka: "Postgres", "PG"
- Short forms: "Anthropic PBC" detected as "Anthropic" → add aka: "Anthropic"

**Execution (use entity_id or name for the entity parameter):**
```
entity_add_aka(facet="work", entity="federal_aviation_administration", aka="FAA")
entity_add_aka(facet="work", entity="PostgreSQL", aka="Postgres")
entity_add_aka(facet="work", entity="postgresql", aka="PG")
```

**When to add aliases:**
- Different name form appeared 2+ times in detections
- Alias is unambiguous (not shared with other entities)
- Natural nickname, acronym, or common abbreviation

**Benefits:** Improves audio transcription recognition and search without cluttering descriptions.

**After all promotions:**
- Summarize promotions and aliases
- Example: "Promoted 3 entities: Sarah Chen [+aka: Bob] (5 detections), API Gateway (5 detections), Federal Aviation Administration [+aka: FAA] (6 detections)"

## Smart Duplicate Handling

**Substring Matches:**
If detected name is substring of entity already attached to THIS facet:
- "Sarah" detected, "Sarah Chen" already attached to this facet → skip "Sarah"
- Prevents fragmentary duplicates within this facet

**Nickname Variations:**
If multiple variations of same person detected:
- "Robert Johnson" (3x) and "Bob" (2x) both detected (5 total)
- Promote with full name, count all variations toward threshold
- Add nickname in Phase 5 using entity_add_aka

**Company Abbreviations:**
If both full name and abbreviation detected:
- "Federal Aviation Administration" (2x) and "FAA" (4x) both detected (6 total)
- Promote with full name, count all variations toward threshold
- Add acronym in Phase 5 using entity_add_aka

## Quality Guidelines

### DO:
- Review full 7-day window systematically
- Apply priority-based thresholds (People: 2+, Companies/Projects: 3-4+, Tools: 5+)
- Prioritize person promotions (lowest threshold)
- Be selective with companies and conservative with projects
- Be very strict with tool/resource promotions
- Synthesize descriptions from multiple contexts
- Remove day-specific temporal references
- Check for exact name matches with attached entities

### DON'T:
- Promote people with only 1 detection (but 2+ is ok)
- Promote organizations/projects/tools below their thresholds
- Promote if entity type is inconsistent across detections
- Promote if already attached to THIS facet (check first)
- Use day-specific descriptions in attached entities
- Batch-promote without individual evaluation
- Promote tools that were just used (require 5+ active discussions)

## Interaction Protocol

When invoked:
1. Announce the SPECIFIC FACET you are reviewing and the review window (last 7 days)
2. Load entities attached to THIS facet for comparison
3. Load detected entities for THIS facet from last 7 days
4. Aggregate by entity name (within this facet), count occurrences
5. Filter by priority-based promotion criteria:
   - People: 2+, Companies/Projects: 3-4+, Tools: 5+
   - Type consistent, not already attached to THIS facet
6. Synthesize timeless descriptions for qualifying entities
7. Execute `entity_attach()` for each promotion to THIS facet
8. Detect name variations and execute `entity_add_aka()` for aliases
9. Summarize: "Promoted X entities for [facet]: [names with aliases and detection counts]"

## Edge Cases

**No Detections**: If no entities meet their priority-based thresholds for THIS facet, report "No entities qualify for promotion this cycle for [facet]"

**All Already Attached**: If all qualifying entities are already attached to THIS facet, report "All recurring entities already attached to [facet]"

**Type Conflicts**: If entity name appears with different types within THIS facet's detections (e.g., "Mercury" as Company and Project), skip and report the ambiguity for manual review

**Below Threshold**: Report entities close to promotion separately:
- "3 entities near promotion for [facet]: Alice (Person, 1 detection - needs 1 more), Acme Corp (Company, 2 detections - needs 1 more)"

Remember: Promotion is a facet-specific one-way operation. Only promote entities with clear evidence of consistent relevance to THIS facet and unambiguous identity. Apply strict priority-based thresholds to maintain quality within this facet.
