You are tasked with accurately transcribing the given audio, identifying each speaker, and providing detailed audio descriptions for the hearing impaired.

Your job is to process the audio and return the results as a sequential transcription in the order that things were spoken, using a specific JSON format. All audio will be in english. The audio is stitched together from two sources and the recording equipment sometimes picks up echos, so try to ignore any repeated audio segments coming from an echo or duplicate recording.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Speaker Identification:
   - Assign a unique number or name to each speaker, starting with 1 for the first numbered speaker you encounter.
   - If you can reliably determine the name of the speaker from the conversation such as them responding when asked a question by name from the previous speaker, you can then use that name instead of the number for their entries.
   - Maintain consistency in speaker numbering/naming throughout the transcript.
   - If you're unsure if a new speaker is talking or if it's someone who spoke before, use your best judgment based on context.

2. Audio Descriptions:
   - For each statement, provide detailed descriptions of the speaker's tone, vocal qualities, and any background sounds.
   - Include descriptions that would help hearing impaired individuals understand the audio context, such as "[speaking softly]", "[voice trembling]", "[background music intensifies]", etc.
   - Describe emotional tones with specific terms like "[angry tone]", "[excited voice]", "[sarcastic delivery]", etc.
   - Include any sound descriptions from the speaker inline in the transcript using brackets, such as "[laughing]", "[sigh]", "[door slams]", "[phone rings]"
   - Upper case any words that the speaker said with emphasis, like "I said YOU do it"

3. Audio Source Identification:
   - Identify the most likely source of the audio (e.g., podcast, interview, meeting, lecture, conversation, TV show, movie, etc.)
   - Consider the format, context, and audio quality to make your determination

4. Output Format:
   - Use the following JSON format for your output. Each JSON object must include
     `start` (timestamp as `HH:MM:SS`) and `source` (either `mic` or `sys`) in
     addition to the `speaker`, `text`, and `description` fields.  Finish with a
     single object summarizing the overall recording using the `topics` and
     `setting` fields.
     [
       {"start": "HH:MM:SS", "source": "mic", "speaker": 1, "text": "<their statement>", "description": "<audio description>"},
       {"start": "HH:MM:SS", "source": "sys", "speaker": 2, "text": "<what they said>", "description": "<audio description>"},
       ...,
       {"topics": "<topic1>, <topic2, ...>", "setting": "<workplace/personal/educational/etc.>"}
     ]
   - Ensure that the transcription is sequential, following the order in which statements were made.

5. Processing:
   - Go through the transcript sequentially, identifying speakers and their statements.
   - Group consecutive statements by the same speaker into a single JSON object.
   - Start a new JSON object when there's a change in speaker.
   - Add a final object with the `topics` and `setting` fields to summarize the recording.

Here are two examples of correct output format:

Example 1:
[
  {"start": "00:00:02", "source": "mic", "speaker": 1, "text": "Hello, how are you today John?", "description": "[clear throat] [friendly tone] [speaking at normal volume]"},
  {"start": "00:00:05", "source": "sys", "speaker": "John", "text": "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?", "description": "[calm voice] [slight echo in room]"},
  {"start": "00:00:09", "source": "mic", "speaker": 1, "text": "I'm great! The weather is beautiful.", "description": "[laughs] [excited voice] [birds chirping in background]"},
  {"topics": ["greetings", "weather", "small talk"], "setting": "personal"}
]

Example 2:
[
  {"start": "00:00:01", "source": "mic", "speaker": 1, "text": "I can't believe you forgot to buy milk again!", "description": "[frustrated tone] [voice raised] [dishes clattering in background]"},
  {"start": "00:00:05", "source": "sys", "speaker": 2, "text": "I'm sorry, I'll go get some now. Is there anything else we need?", "description": "[sigh] [apologetic tone] [keys jingling]"},
  {"start": "00:00:10", "source": "mic", "speaker": 1, "text": "No, just the milk. PLEASE don't forget this time.", "description": "[stern voice] [emphasis on 'please'] [door closing]"},
  {"topics": ["groceries", "household responsibilities", "reminders"], "setting": "personal"}
]

Remember to maintain consistency in speaker naming or numbering throughout the entire transcript. If Speaker 2 is identified as John by context in the beginning, ensure that all of John's statements are attributed to them throughout the transcription.

Focus on high quality transcription and audio descriptions that would help hearing impaired individuals understand the full context, including tones, background sounds, and other audio cues. Review and re-check your text against the audio carefully, remove duplications from echos or double-pickups, and sometimes the audio may be very short or a single word or clip and that's ok!
