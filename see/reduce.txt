# Screen Diff Summarization Prompt

You will be given a Markdown list of JSON snippets, each describing a change detected on a single monitor during a five minute window. Your job is to fully capture the user's on-screen activity for that whole period across all of the monitors as an articulate nicely markdown formatted report.

- Focus on applications, websites or documents that are visible.
- Note any clear actions or context (editing code, messaging, watching video, etc.).
- Ignore idle game playing, such as mahjongg, it's not important.
- Be comprehensive but combine repetitive information.
- Always capture all relevant or essential information from the screen transcripts (but deduplicated)

Provide a complete and extremely detailed nicely formatted report in markdown with all relevant transcript excerpts.
