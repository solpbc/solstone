So we need to finalize the authentication module today. John mentioned that we should use JWT tokens for the session management. The client, Acme Corp, wants to ensure that the security is top-notch.

Let's make sure we have proper unit tests for all the authentication endpoints. I think pytest would be the best framework for this.

We should probably schedule another meeting with the team to discuss the architecture.
