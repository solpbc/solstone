Navigate Intelligently

This repository contains a collection of utilities for multimodal navigation.
The `see` package provides screenshot capture and comparison via the
`screen-watch` command. Screenshots and metadata are cached under
`~/.cache/sunstone/see` between runs. See `see/README.md` for details.
