So the developer, the analyst is syncing the data, and then they go to run the process. So the challenge that we have is making sure that it receives data from the Data Hub. From back when I worked at a previous company, I recall that the Data Hub goes idle after the initial sync, and then it's not sending new data, I don't think. And we would want to see if there's any way that we can have an ALWAYS-ON data stream to our listener from the Data Hub, or if the Data Hub terminates the session completely. If not, then we'd have to devise a way that as soon as the Data Hub is queried, it sends data to our service. We have to assume it has an empty cache at that point. It might sync the first 10% of the data and then start its process and continue syncing in the background. So that was one of the questions to your team was how much access to the data stream is there from the Data Hub during an idle session?", "description": "calm informative tone, clear and articulate"},
