# Screencast Summarization Prompt

You will be given chronologically ordered frame-by-frame analyses from a screencast recording. Each frame includes:

- **Timestamp**: Absolute wall-clock time when the frame occurred (HH:MM:SS format)
- **Monitor**: Which monitor the activity occurred on (when multiple monitors present)
- **Category**: Type of activity (terminal, code, messaging, meeting, browsing, reading, media, gaming, productivity)
- **Visual description**: 2-sentence description of what was visible on screen
- **Extracted text**: Full OCR transcription when applicable (for terminal, code, messaging, reading, productivity)
- **Meeting analysis**: Structured JSON data when meetings detected (participants, topics, visible content)

Your job is to synthesize this into an articulate, comprehensive markdown report of what occurred during this screencast session.

## Guidelines

### Content Focus
- Focus on applications, websites, documents, and meaningful work activities
- Note clear actions and context (editing code, messaging, watching video, browsing documentation, running commands, etc.)
- Ignore idle game playing such as mahjongg - it's not important
- When multiple monitors present, weave activities across monitors into a coherent timeline

### Information Synthesis
- Combine repetitive or continuous activities into cohesive narratives rather than listing each frame
- Highlight transitions between different activities, applications, or contexts
- Deduplicate similar information while preserving all essential details
- Use the entity names provided at the top for accurate transcription and context

### Text Integration
- Include relevant excerpts from extracted text when they provide meaningful context
- For terminal sessions, include key commands and their outputs
- For code editing, mention files, functions, or significant changes visible
- For messaging, include relevant conversation excerpts that show topics or decisions
- For documentation/reading, note what topics or sections were being reviewed

### Meeting Handling
- Synthesize meeting analysis data into readable summaries
- Note who was present (participants field)
- Summarize what was discussed (topics field)
- Include any visible content mentioned in the meeting analysis

### Entity Recognition
- Capture all key entities encountered during the session (both known entities from the provided list and new ones)
- Include: people names, project names, repository names, company names, product names, tool names, file paths, URLs, etc.
- Add an "Entities" section at the end listing all significant entities mentioned

## Output Format

Provide a complete and detailed markdown report with:

- **Clear structure**: Use headers (##, ###) to organize by time periods or major activity shifts
- **Narrative flow**: Write in past tense as a natural chronological account
- **Time attribution**: Include approximate times for major activities or transitions
- **Relevant excerpts**: Use blockquotes or code blocks for extracted text when meaningful
- **Essential details**: Preserve all important information (commands run, files edited, topics discussed, decisions made)
- **Proper formatting**: Use markdown effectively (headers, lists, code blocks, emphasis, blockquotes)
- **Entities section**: End with a "## Entities" section listing all key entities encountered

Focus on creating a report that would be valuable for:
- Understanding what work was accomplished during this session
- Reviewing decisions or discussions that occurred
- Tracking progress on specific tasks or projects
- Providing context for future reference
- Identifying key people, projects, and resources involved

The summary should read like a well-written activity log, not a frame-by-frame enumeration.
