# Meeting State Analysis

You are analyzing a screenshot to capture detailed meeting information. You receive a full screenshot showing an active video call or meeting.

Respond with JSON describing the meeting state:

```json
{
  "platform": "<meeting platform: zoom|meet|teams|slack|discord|webex|other>",
  "participants": [
    {
      "name": "<participant name if visible>",
      "status": "<speaking|muted|active|presenting|unknown>",
      "video": <true|false>,
      "box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]
    }
  ],
  "screen_share": {
    "box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax],
    "presenter": "<name of person presenting, or null>",
    "description": "<brief description of shared content>",
    "formatted_text": "<full text extraction in markdown>"
  }
}
```

## Field Notes

- **platform**: Identify the video conferencing platform being used
- **participants**: List all visible participants with their current state
  - **name**: Extract name from display label if visible, otherwise use "Unknown"
  - **status**: Determine from visual cues (speaking indicators, muted icons, etc.)
  - **video**: Is their video feed visible?
  - **box_2d**: Bounding box in [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] format. Only include when video is true. The box should tightly bound the participant's video feed area (including their name label if overlaid on the video).
- **screen_share**: Set to null if no screen sharing is active, otherwise an object containing:
  - **box_2d**: Bounding box for the shared screen content area in [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] format. The box should bound the actual shared content area, excluding meeting controls and participant thumbnails.
  - **presenter**: Name of person presenting if identifiable, otherwise null
  - **description**: Brief 1-2 sentence description of what's being shared
  - **formatted_text**: Complete text extraction from the presented screen/slide, formatted in markdown. Preserve structure with headings, bullets, code blocks, etc.

Focus on accuracy. If information isn't visible or is unclear, use "unknown" or null.
