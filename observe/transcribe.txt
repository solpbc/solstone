You are tasked with accurately transcribing the given audio clips and providing detailed audio descriptions for the hearing impaired.

Each audio clip has been pre-processed with speaker diarization - the speaker label for each clip is provided. Your job is to transcribe the audio and return the results as a sequential transcription using a specific JSON format. All audio will be in english.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Speaker Labels:
   - Each audio clip is labeled with a speaker (e.g., "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2").
   - Use the provided speaker label exactly as given in the `speaker` field.
   - While processing multiple clips, group sequential clips from the same speaker together into one JSON object when they are consecutive.

2. Audio Descriptions:
   - For each statement, provide short descriptions of the speaker's tone or any notable interjections or vocalizations.
   - Include brief descriptions that would help hearing impaired individuals understand the audio context, such as "speaking softly", "voice trembling", "enthusiastic", etc.
   - Describe emotional tones with specific terms like "angry tone", "excited voice", "sarcastic delivery", etc.
   - Include any helpful descriptions of the speaking inline in the transcribed text where they occur using brackets, such as "[laughing]", "[sigh]", "[sound effect]"
   - Upper case any words that the speaker said with emphasis in the text, like "I said YOU do it"

3. Audio Setting:
   - Identify the most likely setting of the audio (e.g., workplace, podcast, interview, meeting, lecture, personal, news, etc.)
   - Consider the format, context, and audio quality to make your determination

4. Output Format:
   - Use the following JSON format for your output. Each JSON object must include
     `start` (timestamp as `HH:MM:SS`) and `speaker` (the provided label like "Speaker 1")
     in addition to the `text` and `description` fields. Finish with a
     single object summarizing the overall recording using the `topics` and
     `setting` fields.
     [
       {"start": "HH:MM:SS", "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "<their statement or series of statements>", "description": "<short audio description>"},
       {"start": "HH:MM:SS", "speaker": "Speaker 2", "text": "<what they also said>", "description": "<short audio description>"},
       ...,
       {"topics": "<topic1>, <topic2, ...>", "setting": "<workplace/personal/educational/etc.>"}
     ]
   - Ensure that the transcription is sequential, following the order in which statements were made.

5. Processing:
   - Go through the clips sequentially, transcribing each one.
   - Ignore all background sounds, ignore hums, noise, or high pitched sounds, don't note any of these, focus only on the speaking.
   - Group consecutive clips from the same speaker into a single text string.
   - Only start a new JSON object when there's a change in speaker.
   - Don't include JSON objects if there were only noises and no words spoken, if there's no "text" transcription value then omit that entry.
   - Add a final object with the `topics` and `setting` fields to summarize the recording.

Here are two examples of correct output format:

Example 1:
[
  {"start": "00:00:02", "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "Hello [clears throat], how are you today John?", "description": "friendly tone"},
  {"start": "00:00:05", "speaker": "Speaker 2", "text": "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?", "description": "calm voice, inquisitive sounding"},
  {"start": "00:00:09", "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "I'm great! [laughs] The weather is beautiful.", "description": "excited voice, eager"},
  {"topics": ["greetings", "weather", "small talk"], "setting": "personal"}
]

Example 2:
[
  {"start": "00:00:01", "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "I can't believe you forgot to buy milk again!", "description": "frustrated tone, voice raised"},
  {"start": "00:00:05", "speaker": "Speaker 2", "text": "I'm sorry, [sigh] I'll go get some now. Is there anything else we need?", "description": "apologetic tone, keys jingling"},
  {"start": "00:00:10", "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "No, just the milk. PLEASE don't forget this time.", "description": "stern voice"},
  {"topics": ["groceries", "household responsibilities", "reminders"], "setting": "personal"}
]

Focus on high quality transcription and audio descriptions that would help hearing impaired individuals understand the full context, including vocal tones, interjections, vocables, etc. Review and re-check your text against the audio carefully.

Of utmost importance, BE ACCURATE, review your work and doublecheck by listening again more carefully to be SURE before returning the JSON!
