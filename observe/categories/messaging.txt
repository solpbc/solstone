# Messaging App Text Extraction

Extract text from this messaging or email screenshot (Slack, Discord, Messages, Gmail, Teams, etc.).

## Header

`# [App Name - Channel/Conversation]`

## Conversation Format

Extract messages with sender attribution:

```markdown
**Alice**: Hey, how's it going?
**Bob**: Pretty good, working on the new feature
```

Include timestamps if visible: `**Alice** (2:34 PM): message`

Use `>` blockquotes for quoted/forwarded messages. Use code fences for code snippets.

## Quality

- Focus on message content, skip UI chrome
- Preserve conversation order and flow
- Mark unclear text with `[unclear]`
- Mark cut-off text with `...`

Return ONLY the formatted markdown.
