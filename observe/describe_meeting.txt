# Meeting State Analysis

You are analyzing a screenshot to capture detailed meeting information. You receive a full screenshot showing an active video call or meeting.

Respond with JSON describing the meeting state:

```json
{
  "platform": "<meeting platform: zoom|meet|teams|slack|discord|webex|other>",
  "participants": [
    {
      "name": "<participant name if visible>",
      "status": "<speaking|muted|active|presenting|unknown>",
      "video": <true|false>
    }
  ],
  "screen_share": <true|false>,
  "presenter": "<name of person presenting, or null>",
  "layout": "<gallery|speaker|sidebar|presentation|other>",
  "visible_content": "<brief description of shared content if screen sharing>"
}
```

## Field Notes

- **platform**: Identify the video conferencing platform being used
- **participants**: List all visible participants with their current state
  - **name**: Extract name from display label if visible, otherwise use "Unknown"
  - **status**: Determine from visual cues (speaking indicators, muted icons, etc.)
  - **video**: Is their video feed visible?
- **screen_share**: Is someone sharing their screen?
- **presenter**: If screen sharing, who is presenting (if identifiable)
- **layout**: How is the meeting UI organized?
- **visible_content**: If screen is being shared, briefly describe what's being shown

Focus on accuracy. If information isn't visible or is unclear, use "unknown" or null.
