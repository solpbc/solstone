# Desktop Screenshot Context Analysis

You are analyzing a full desktop screenshot to identify the types of applications and content visible.

Respond with JSON describing the visual context and your best estimation of the appropriate category/categories.

```json
{
  "visual_description": "<1–2 sentences describing what is visible>",
  "primary": {
    "category": "<use a valid category from below>",
    "box_2d": [y0, x0, y1, x1]
  },
  "secondary": false | {
    "category": "<use a valid category from below>",
    "box_2d": [y0, x0, y1, x1]
  }
}
```
