## Special Notes

- The user is often multi-tasking where they are joined on a team zoom in the background while working on an unrelated task, so the audio transcripts may not always align with the screen transcripts.
- Take time to consider all of the nuance of the interactions from the day, deeply think through how best to prioritize the most important aspects and understandings, formulate the best approach for each step of the analysis.

Remember: The goal is to provide insights that genuinely help the person work and organize more effectively, not just describe what happened.
