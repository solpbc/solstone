# Screen Diff Summarization Prompt

You will be given a Markdown list of JSON snippets, each describing a change detected on a single monitor during a five minute window. Summarize the user's on-screen activity for that period.

- Focus on applications, websites or documents that are visible.
- Note any clear actions or context (editing code, messaging, watching video, etc.).
- Ignore trivial cursor movements or minor UI updates.
- Keep the summary concise and combine repetitive information.

Respond with 2–3 short bullet points.
