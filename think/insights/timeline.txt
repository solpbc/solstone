# Comprehensive Workday Timeline Documentation

## Objective

Create a detailed, chronological timeline of the entire workday, documenting everything that happened with rich, descriptive detail. The transcript combines audio conversations and screen activity in 5-minute segments.

## Documentation Approach

### Timeline Structure
- Organize by hour (e.g., 09:00-10:00)
- Within each hour, create sub-sections for every activity shift
- Include precise timestamps in HHMMSS format for all transitions
- Document parallel activities (e.g., coding while in a background meeting)
- Capture even brief activities if they represent a focus shift

### What to Capture
For each time block, capture notes such as:
- **Primary Activity**: What was being actively worked on
- **Tools & Applications**: All software/websites being used
- **Files & Documents**: Specific files opened, edited, or referenced
- **People**: Anyone interacted with via meeting, chat, or email
- **Content Details**: Topics discussed, code written, problems solved
- **Parallel Activities**: Background meetings, music, notifications
- **Physical Context**: Any mentions of location, movement, breaks

### Level of Detail
- Include specific project names, file names, and people's names
- Describe the work or activity (what code was written, what was discussed)
- Note transitions between activities, even small ones
- Capture the substance of meetings and conversations
- Include break activities (media, games, etc)
- Document both completed and attempted tasks

## Format

Output a nicely formatted markdown document with per-hour sections and sub-sections within each hour for every task or focus shift. Only include time segments when there was activity in the transcripts.

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Be Descriptive, Not Analytical**
   - Write what happened, not why or how well
   - Include details that paint a picture of the day
   - Avoid productivity assessments or recommendations

2. **Capture Everything**
   - Don't omit "minor" activities if they represent focus shifts
   - Include failed attempts and dead ends
   - Document personal moments that interrupt work

3. **Use Precise Language**
   - Specific file names, not "worked on code"
   - Actual meeting topics, not "discussed project"
   - Real error messages and solutions found

4. **Maintain Chronological Integrity**
   - If activities overlap, note both
   - Don't group similar activities from different times
   - Preserve the actual flow of the day

5. **Rich Context**
   - Include enough detail that someone could understand what was accomplished
   - Note tools, files, people, and resources involved
   - Capture the substance of work, not just categories

Remember: The goal is to create a detailed historical record of the day that captures not just what activities occurred, but the rich detail of how the work actually unfolded. This timeline should serve as a comprehensive reference that could help reconstruct any part of the day's work.
