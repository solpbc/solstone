# Future Schedule Extraction

**Input:** A markdown file containing chronologically ordered transcripts of a workday. The transcript combines audio recordings and screen activity in 5-minute segments.

**Objective:** Identify and extract all future scheduled events and calendar entries visible or mentioned throughout the day. Focus exclusively on events scheduled for dates beyond today - not current day or historical events.

**Instructions:**

1. **Scan for Calendar Views:** Review all screen activity descriptions for:
   - Calendar applications (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.)
   - Scheduling interfaces (Calendly, meeting schedulers, etc.)
   - Email invitations showing future dates
   - Project management tools with scheduled deadlines
   - Any interface displaying future dates and times

2. **Extract Event Details:** For each future scheduled item identified, capture:
   - **Date & Time:** Full date and time information if available
   - **Event Title:** The name or subject of the scheduled event
   - **Participants:** Meeting attendees or people involved if visible
   - **Location:** Physical location or meeting link/platform
   - **Duration:** Expected length of the event
   - **Description:** Any additional context or agenda items visible

3. **Organize Chronologically:** Sort all identified events by their scheduled date and time, nearest future events first.

4. **Focus on the Future:**
   - Include only events scheduled for tomorrow and beyond
   - Exclude today's events (already happened or happening)
   - Exclude past events visible in calendar history
   - Include recurring events' future instances if visible

## Output Format

Produce a clean Markdown document with:

### Header Section
A brief overview stating the date range of scheduled events found and total count.

### Event Listings
For each future event, create a formatted entry with:
- **Date:** [Day, Full Date]
- **Time:** [Start - End time with timezone if available]
- **Event:** [Title/Subject]
- **Participants:** [List of attendees if visible]
- **Location:** [Physical/Virtual location]
- **Notes:** [Any additional context, agenda items, or preparation needed]

### Summary
Conclude with a brief summary highlighting:
- The next upcoming event
- Any particularly important or unusual scheduled items
- General schedule density for the upcoming segment

## Important Notes
- Only extract what is clearly visible on screen or captured in a transcript
- Don't infer or guess event details
- Focus on definite scheduled items, not tentative plans mentioned in conversation
- Include both personal and professional scheduled events if visible
