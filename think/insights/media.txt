# Workday Media Consumption Analysis

## Objective

Analyze a single day's transcripts to identify instances of media consumption. The transcripts combine audio and screen summaries in chronological 5‑minute chunks.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Detect Media Moments**
   * Review the entire day's transcripts looking for clear signs of media consumption. This includes:
     - Videos or streaming content
     - News articles or blog posts
     - Music or podcasts
     - Social media browsing
     - Viewing photos or image galleries
     - Any other recreational, professional growth, or informational content
   * Flag both audio mentions and screen evidence (e.g. a YouTube tab, news site, music player, photo viewer, etc.).

2. **Classify Work vs. Personal**
   * For each media instance, determine whether it appears to be work‑related or personal.
   * Consider the surrounding context, titles, or content. For example, a technical artical related to a work project is "work," while entertainment videos or casual news are "personal." If uncertain, make your best guess.

3. **Record Topics and Sources**
   * Capture the main topic or subject matter of the media (technology news, project documentation, politics, entertainment, etc.).
   * Note the websites or applications involved (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, New York Times, Spotify). Include URLs if visible in the transcript.

## Output Format

Produce a friendly markdown document with chronological individual sections with a short title and each containing these items:

  - Time Segment(s)
  - Media Type (video, article, music, etc.)
  - Work or Personal
  - Topic/Description
  - Source or Site

At the end add a Summary Insights section with bullet points highlighting overall trends, how much time was spent consuming media, and whether it leaned more toward work or personal purposes.

Be thoughtful, the goal is to surface where time was spent on external content and its relative importance to work and personal life. There should be no more than a few dozen notable items every day.
