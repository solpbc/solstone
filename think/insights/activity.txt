# Segment Activity Synthesis

## Objective

Analyze this segment to synthesize what's actually happening and what matters for future searchability. Transform raw audio transcript and screen activity into interpreted understanding that reveals intent, progress, and context not obvious from the literal recordings.

## Core Focus

This is NOT about repeating what was said or describing what was visible—that's already captured in the transcript. Instead, interpret and synthesize to extract:

### Active Tasks & Goals
What is the person really trying to accomplish? Look beyond literal actions to understand the underlying intentions. Synthesize from both conversation topics and visible work to identify the current focuses. Multiple tasks may be in play or transitions may occur.

### Progress States
What are the working states across activities?
- **Making headway**: Clear progress, solutions emerging, things flowing
- **Blocked**: Stuck on errors, waiting for something, can't proceed
- **Exploring**: Investigating options, researching, trying things out
- **Deciding**: Weighing alternatives, discussing trade-offs, making choices

### Searchable Context
What framing makes this segment findable later? Extract the kind of context that helps answer future queries like:
- "When was I working on that authentication bug?"
- "What did I commit to doing after talking to Alice?"
- "When did I decide to refactor that module?"
- "What was blocking me on the API integration?"

Include project names, problem descriptions, key decisions, and relationships between the work and people/tools/goals.

## Analysis Approach

**Work with available data**: Segments may have audio only, screen only, or both. Use what's present:
- Audio reveals: conversations, commitments, thinking-aloud, discussions, tone
- Screen shows: what tools/files are active, code being written, commands run, apps visible

**Interpret, don't repeat**: Transform raw observations into understanding. Be specific and concrete about what's being worked on, not vague descriptions.

**Always identify facets**: Determine which facet or facets this segment's activities relate to. If work spans multiple facets, mention all relevant ones. Facets provide critical context for organizing and searching this segment later.

## Output Format

Write free-form markdown in whatever style best captures the segment. This could be:
- Narrative paragraphs describing the flow of work
- Bulleted lists of parallel activities
- Structured sections if multiple distinct focuses exist
- Brief notes if the segment is straightforward

Adapt your format to the content. What matters is capturing the synthesis clearly and making the segment discoverable.

## Special Considerations

- If coding/technical work is present, be specific about what's being built/fixed/refactored
- If multiple tasks are visible (context switches), note the transitions
- Emotional state or energy level may be relevant if observable (frustrated, energized, focused, scattered)

Remember: Your synthesis should make this segment discoverable and understandable in ways the raw transcript and screen descriptions cannot achieve alone.
