# Comprehensive Workday Knowledge Graph and Network Analysis from Transcripts

**Input:** A markdown file containing a chronologically ordered transcript of a workday for $name. The transcript is segmented into 5-minute chunks, each combining information from audio recordings and screen activity for that interval.

**Objective:** Generate a comprehensive knowledge graph and perform a network analysis based on the provided workday transcripts.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Entity Extraction and Profiling:**
    * Identify all distinct entities. Categorize entities using appropriate types such as: `Person`, `Organization` (companies, groups, teams), `Project`, `Task`, `Concept` (abstract ideas, features, problem domains), `Tool` (software, applications, physical tools), `Location`, `Event`, and `Topic` (general subjects of discussion), or other contextually relevant categories.
    * For each identified entity, provide:
        * `Entity Name`: The canonical name of the entity.
        * `Entity Type`: Its category from the list above.
        * `First Appearance`: Time.
        * `Total Engagement`: Approximately how many times was it mentioned throughout the day.
        * `Context`:  Provide a concise (1-2 sentence) summary of its role or context in how it was used, referencing key actions or discussions from both audio and screen data if distinguishable.

2.  **Relationship Mapping:**
    * Identify and map all significant connections between entities.
    * For each connection, define:
        * `Source Name`
        * `Target Name`
        * `Relationship Type`: Use descriptive labels (e.g., `works-on`, `discusses-with`, `uses-tool-for-project`, `reports-to`, `blocked-by`, `enables`, `references-concept`, `mentions-organization`). Be prepared to infer novel relationship types if the provided examples are insufficient, and briefly justify any novel types.

3.  **Network Analysis and Insights:**
    * Based on the extracted entities and relationships, identify and describe:
        * `Hub Entities`: Entities with the highest number of diverse connections, acting as central points in the workday. List the top 3-5.
        * `Bridge Entities`: Entities that uniquely connect disparate clusters of entities or topics that would otherwise be disconnected.
        * `Orphan Idea`: Concepts, tasks, or topics mentioned but not substantially connected to other entities or followed up upon.
        * `Temporal Flows`: Describe how attention and activity move through the network over time. For example, "Morning focused on Project X involving Person A and Tool Y, shifting to Concept Z discussions with Person B in the afternoon."

4.  **Output Format:**
    * **Part 1: Friendly Markdown Report:**
        * A list of all entities with their profiles (from step 1).
        * A list of all relationships (from step 2).
    * **Part 2: Narrative Analysis (Markdown):**
        * A summary of the key findings from the Network Analysis (step 3).
        * A qualitative description of what a visual network diagram of this day would highlight. Include specific examples of the 2-3 most interesting or unexpected connections discovered, explaining why they are noteworthy (e.g., "An interesting connection is Person A using Tool Z, typically associated with Project Q, for an ad-hoc task related to Concept R. This suggests a novel application or workaround.").

**Key Considerations:**
* Synthesize information from both audio and screen transcript data within each chunk.
* Disambiguate entities: e.g., "John" referring to "John Doe."
* Infer implicit relationships where explicit statements are lacking but context strongly suggests a connection.
* Focus on the most relevant and significant entities and relationships to avoid an overly noisy graph.
* $Preferred often multi-tasks where joined on a team zoom in the background while working on an unrelated task, so the audio transcripts may not always align with the screen transcripts.
* Take time to consider all of the nuance of the interactions from the day, deeply think through how best to prioritize the most important aspects and understandings, formulate the best approach for each step of the analysis.
