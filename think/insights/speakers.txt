# Meeting Speaker Detection

## Objective

Identify meetings and multi-person discussions in this segment and extract possible participant names.

## Input Types

### With Screen Activity

A meeting is detected when screen activity shows a video conferencing application:
- Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex, or similar
- Participant panels or video tiles visible
- Meeting controls or UI elements present

Extract participant names from:
1. **Visible participant list/panel** on screen
2. **Names spoken in conversation** - direct address ("Thanks, Sarah"), mentions ("John was saying...")
3. **Self-introductions** ("Hi, I'm Alex from...")

### Audio Only

When no screen activity is present, a meeting is detected when audio shows:
- Multiple speakers with conversational turn-taking
- Meeting-style patterns: agenda items, discussion, decisions, action items
- Professional/work context evident from topics
- Personal discussions amongst friends or family

Extract names from:
1. **Names spoken in conversation** - direct address and mentions
2. **Self-introductions**
3. **Any setting metadata** if available from transcription
4. **Facet** if given, possible entities based on the given facet

## Boundary Detection

If the segment spans two distinct meetings with different participants (one ending, another starting):
- Look for farewell patterns followed by new greetings
- Different participant set appears
- Significant topic shift with new introductions

Report each meeting separately with its own time range and participants.

## Output Format

Structure your output as clean well formatted markdown with the following information included:

- **Time**: HH:MM:SS - HH:MM:SS
- **Platform**: Zoom / Meet / Teams / etc. (if visible, omit for audio-only)
- **Participants**:
  - Speaker Name
  - Another Speaker Name

Your result may have 0, 1, or 2 of the above sections. Our goal is to identify all the possible speakers based on the evidence.

## What to Ignore

- Podcasts, videos, or streaming content being watched
- Music or background audio

## No Meeting Case

If no meeting is detected, output just "No meetings detected"
