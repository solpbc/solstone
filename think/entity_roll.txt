### **Prompt for Top Entities Knowledge Graph Generation for Disambiguation**

**Objective:**

Your task is to process a collection of daily knowledge graphs, each generated from potentially error-prone transcriptions, and create a list that will the most helpful for disambiguation. From this collection, you will create a single, consolidated, and authoritative top list of the most important entities. The final output should be a clean, deduplicated list formatted as specified below.

**Input:**

You will be given a series of knowledge graphs, each representing a single day. Each graph contains entities of various types (e.g., Person, Project, Company, Tool, others) along with a short description. Be aware that the same entity may appear across multiple days, sometimes with minor spelling variations or different descriptions due to transcription errors and evolving context.

**Instructions:**

Follow these steps to build the top list:

1.  **Aggregate Entities:** Begin by considering a comprehensive list of every entity from every daily knowledge graph provided.
    * **Important Entities:** Since this list is primarily for disambiguation, focus only on Person, Project, Company, and Tool entity types. Capturing all of the Company and Person entities is important.
    * **Ignored Entities:** Disregard entity types of Concept, Topic, and Task, they are not helpful when doing transcriptions.

2.  **Normalize and Deduplicate Entities (Entity Resolution):** This is the most critical step. Your goal is to identify and merge duplicate entries into a single, canonical record that can be a reference for transcription accuracy.
    * **Group by Similarity:** Group proper named entities that appear to be the same. Use fuzzy string matching, phonetic similarity, and contextual clues to identify potential duplicates (e.g., "Jeremie Miller," "Jeremy Miller," and "Jer" mentioned in a software context might be the same person).
    * **Establish a Canonical Name:** For each group of duplicate entities, determine the most common or most likely correct spelling for the name. This will be the authoritative name in the top list.
    * **Include Nickname:** Optionally, if the entity has a nickname then include that in parenthesis after their name, but ONLY if the nickname is *different* than any part of the name.
    * **Synthesize Descriptions:** Combine the descriptions from all occurrences of an entity into a single, concise one-sentence summary. If descriptions conflict, prioritize the most frequently occurring or most detailed information. The final description should capture the bare essence of the entity's role or nature across all mentions.

3.  **Prioritize and Rank:** Not all entities are equally important. You must identify the most significant ones to include in the final list.
    * **Calculate Frequency:** Determine the importance of an entity by noticing how many different days it appears on. An entity mentioned across many days is more significant than one mentioned only once.
    * **Filter the List:** Return all entities that are mentioned more than once. The final list should fully capture all of the prominent people, companies, tools and topics discussed and used over the entire period.
    * **Prioritize Types:** Try to capture more Person and Project entities, only the most unique Tool and Company entities are important.

4.  **Format the Final Output:**
    * Present the final, prioritized list as a bulleted list.
    * Each item must follow the exact format: `* [Type]: [Canonical Name] - [Synthesized Short Description]`
    * Ensure there are no duplicate entities in the final output.
    * Capture all of the relevant entities directly observed in the user data.

**Example Output Format:**

* Company: ACME - A technology company that produces advanced widgets and is headquartered in Phoenix.
* Person: Jeremie Miller (Jer) - A key software engineer and the original creator of the Jabber/XMPP technology.
* Tool: Widgetizer 3000 - A next-generation widget design engine known for its efficiency and precision.
* Project: XMPP - An open-source communication protocol for real-time messaging and presence.
