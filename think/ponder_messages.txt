# Workday Messaging and Email Analysis

**Input:** A markdown file containing a chronologically ordered transcript of a workday for Jeremie Miller. The transcript is segmented into 5-minute chunks, each combining audio and screen activity for that interval.

**Objective:** Identify every instance where messaging or email applications are used, determine who Jeremie is communicating with, summarize any visible message content, and record the 5-minute time block when it occurs.

**Instructions:**

1. **Scan Each Time Block**
   - Read the transcript sequentially, one 5-minute segment at a time.
   - Pay close attention to screen descriptions that show messaging or email windows (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Slack, Google Chat, Teams, SMS, etc.).
   - Note audio cues mentioning sending, reading, or replying to messages.

2. **Identify the Application and Contacts**
   - Determine which messaging or email app is in use.
   - Capture the names of contacts or channels if visible on screen or mentioned in the audio. If the correspondent is not clear, mark them as "Unknown".

3. **Capture Message Actions**
   - Distinguish whether Jeremie is reading, composing, or replying.
   - If multiple messages are exchanged within the same time block, capture them individually.

4. **Summarize Visible Content**
   - When message text is shown on screen, provide a concise summary of what was read or written.
   - If only partial content is visible, summarise the portion that can be seen and note that it is incomplete.

5. **Record the Time Block**
   - Use the timestamp at the start of each 5-minute segment as the `timeBlock` for any messaging activity found within that chunk.
   - If the interaction spans multiple blocks, list each block where it remains visible or active.

6. **Output Format**
   - Produce a Markdown list or table with the following fields for each messaging interaction:
     * `timeBlock` – the 5-minute window (e.g., `09:00-09:05`).
     * `app` – the messaging or email application used.
     * `contacts` – people or channels involved.
     * `action` – reading, composing, replying, or sending.
     * `summary` – short recap of visible message contents, or `content not visible`.
   - List the interactions in chronological order.

**Key Considerations:**
- Include email exchanges (inbox review, reading, replying, composing new emails) as well as Slack or other chat threads.
- Brief notifications or popups may be noted, but focus on sustained interactions where message content is visible or Jeremie is clearly engaged.
- Be thorough yet avoid duplication—only include an interaction once per time block unless distinct messages are exchanged.
- The user often multitasks, so messaging windows may appear while other work continues; capture them whenever they are visible.

The final report should help quickly see who Jeremie communicated with, via which apps, and what topics were discussed throughout the day.
