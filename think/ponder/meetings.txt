# Workday Meeting Extraction and Analysis

**Input:** A markdown file containing a chronologically ordered transcript of a workday for Jeremie Miller. The transcript is segmented into 5-minute chunks, each combining information from audio recordings and screen activity for that interval.

**Objective:** Identify and summarize all of the meetings that Jeremie participated in based on the provided workday transcripts, generate a JSON array with the details for each.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Parse the Input:** Read the entire markdown file, paying close attention to the chronological 5-minute timestamps.

2.  **Identify Meetings:** Iterate through the time chunks to identify the start and end of meetings.
    * **Meeting Start Cues:** A meeting may be starting if the audio transcript includes:
        * Greetings and introductory phrases (e.g., "Hi everyone," "Let's get started," "Thanks for joining," "How are you?").
        * The names of other individuals joining the conversation.
        * The distinct sound of a video conferencing notification.
        * A noticable change in topic from previous transcripts.
        * The timestamps, since meetings often begin at the top of the hour or half-past.
    * **Meeting End Cues:** A meeting may be ending if the audio transcript includes:
        * Closing remarks (e.g., "Great, thanks everyone," "Let's wrap up," "Talk to you all later").
        * A clear shift to a prolonged period of silence or non-conversational audio (e.g., only keyboard sounds).
    * **Use Screen Activity for Confirmation:** While Jeremie's screen activity can be distracting due to multitasking, it can be a helpful secondary indicator. Look for the launch or presence of meeting software (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) to help confirm the start of a meeting. There may be meetings in the audio transcript only with no clues on the screen.
    * **Audio Required:** Meetings must have an audio component, if only visual/screen references exist without the audio transcript than it probably wasn't a meeting.

3.  **Extract Key Meeting Details:** For each identified meeting, extract the following information, prioritizing the audio transcript as the primary source of truth:

    * **Meeting Time Range:**
        * `startTime`: The timestamp when the meeting is first identified as having started.
        * `endTime`: The timestamp when the meeting is identified as having concluded.

    * **Participants:**
        * Carefully analyze the audio transcript for the names of individuals who are speaking or who are referred to by name.
        * The screen may occasionally show a list of participants in the meeting software; use this to supplement the names gathered from the audio. List "Jeremie Miller" as a default participant for all identified meetings.
        * See if the names overlap allowing for transcription errors, try to consolidate them when possible.

    * **Topics Discussed:**
        * Synthesize the conversation from the audio transcript to create a concise summary of the key subjects and topics being discussed, any entities being named, technologies being used, companies, etc.

    * **Meeting Brief:**
        * Create a short one-liner brief or title describing the meeting that can be shown for helpful context in a list of meetings.

    * **Slides Presented:**
        * `slidesPresented`: Boolean indicating whether presentation slides were clearly visible on screen during any part of the meeting.
        * `slidesDescription`: If slides were presented, provide a short summary of the slide content, topics covered, or presentation themes visible on screen. Omit if no slides were presented.
        * Look for screen activity showing presentation software (PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote, etc.), slide transitions, or structured presentation content being displayed within the meeting window, etc.

4.  **Format the Output:** Generate a single JSON array where each object represents a meeting and contains the extracted details. The structure of each JSON object should be as follows:

```json
[
    {
    "startTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "endTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "participants": [
        "Jeremie Miller",
        "Participant Name 1",
        "Participant Name 2"
    ],
    "topicsDiscussed": "A list of the meeting's key topics, subjects, names mentioned, etc.",
    "title": "Short one-liner title or brief of the meeting for easy reference.",
    "slidesPresented": true/false,
    "slidesDescription": "Optional, short summary of slide content, topics, or themes if slides were presented"
    },
    ...
]
```
