# Occurrence JSON Conversion

You are given a Markdown summary that was generated from a day's transcripts. Extract every distinct event it describes and convert them into the **occurrence** JSON format defined in `JOURNAL.md`.

Use these fields for each occurrence:
- `type` – meeting, message, file, followup, documentation, research, media, etc.
- `source` – the name of the summary file being processed.
- `start` and `end` – HH:MM:SS timestamps.
- `title` – short description of the event.
- `summary` – one sentence recap.
- `work` – `true` for work related, `false` for personal.
- `participants` – names of people or entities involved if known.
- `details` – any additional type specific information.

Return only a **JSON array** containing the occurrences. Do not wrap it in any additional object or text.
Capture as much specific information as possible and include any extra fields that clarify the occurrence inside `details`. Output only valid JSON with no extra commentary.
