# Development Guidelines & Contribution Standards

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to solstone, whether you're an AI assistant, human developer, or automated system.

## Project Overview

**solstone** is a Python-based AI-driven desktop journaling toolkit that provides:

* **observe/** - Multimodal capture (audio + visual) and AI-powered analysis
* **think/** - Data post-processing, summarization, and intelligent insights
* **convey/** - Web application for navigating and interacting with captured content (extensible via apps/)
* **muse/** - AI agent system and MCP tooling

The project uses a modular architecture where each package can operate independently while sharing common utilities and data formats through the journal system.

---

## Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for working with solstone:

* **Journal**: Central data structure organized as `JOURNAL_PATH/YYYYMMDD/` directories. All captured data, transcripts, and analysis artifacts are stored here. See [docs/JOURNAL.md](docs/JOURNAL.md).

* **Facets**: Project/context organization system (e.g., "work", "personal", "acme"). Facets group related content and provide scoped views of entities, tasks, and activities.

* **Entities**: Extracted information (people, projects, concepts) tracked over time across transcripts and interactions. Entities are associated with facets and enable semantic navigation.

* **Agents**: AI processors with configurable personas that analyze content, extract insights, and respond to queries. See [docs/CORTEX.md](docs/CORTEX.md).

* **Callosum**: Message bus that enables asynchronous communication between components. See [docs/CALLOSUM.md](docs/CALLOSUM.md).

* **Indexer**: Builds and maintains SQLite database from journal data, enabling fast search and retrieval.

├── think/          # Data post-processing & AI analysis
├── convey/         # Web app frontend & backend
├── apps/           # Convey app extensions (see docs/APPS.md)

└── README.md       # Project overview
```

Each package has a README.md symlink pointing to its documentation in `docs/`.

### Package Organization

* **Modules**: Each top-level folder is a Python package with `__init__.py` unless it is data-only (e.g., `fixtures/`)
* **Imports**: Prefer absolute imports (e.g., `from think.utils import setup_cli`) whenever feasible
* **Entry Points**: Defined in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.scripts]` - see this file for the full list of available commands
* **Journal**: Data stored under `JOURNAL_PATH` environment variable location always loaded from .env
* **Calling**: When calling other modules as a separate process always use their command name and never call using `python -m ...` (e.g., use `think-indexer`, NOT `python -m think.indexer`)

---

## Architecture & Data Flow

**Core Pipeline**: `observe` (capture) → JSON transcripts → `think` (analyze) → SQLite index → `convey` (web UI)

**Data Organization**:
* Everything organized under `JOURNAL_PATH/YYYYMMDD/` daily directories
* Facets provide project-scoped organization and filtering
* Entities are extracted from transcripts and tracked across time
* Indexer builds SQLite database for fast search and retrieval

**Component Communication**:
* Callosum message bus enables async communication between services
* Cortex orchestrates agent execution, managing requests and event distribution
* Agents process via `muse-agents` command with persona configurations

**Command Reference**:
See `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]` for the authoritative, current list of CLI entry points (e.g., `solstone`, `think-*`, `observe-*`, `muse-*`, `convey*`).

---

## Testing with Fixtures

```python
# Use comprehensive mock journal data for testing
os.environ["JOURNAL_PATH"] = "fixtures/journal"
# Now all journal operations work with test data
```

The `fixtures/journal/` directory contains a complete mock journal structure with sample facets, agents, transcripts, and indexed data for testing.

## Coding Standards & Style

### Language & Tools
* **Black** (`make format`) - Code formatting
* **isort** (`make format`) - Import sorting
* **flake8** (`make lint`) - Linting
* **mypy** (`make check`) - Type checking
* Configuration in `pyproject.toml`

### Naming Conventions
* **Modules/Functions/Variables**: `snake_case`
* **Classes**: `PascalCase`
* **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
* **Private Members**: `_leading_underscore`

### Code Organization
* **Imports**: Prefer absolute imports, grouped (stdlib, third-party, local), one per line
* **Docstrings**: Google or NumPy style with parameter/return descriptions
* **Type Hints**: Should be included on function signatures (legacy helpers may still need updates)
* **File Structure**: Constants → helpers → classes → main/CLI

### File Headers
All source files must begin with a license and copyright header:
```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
# Copyright (c) 2026 sol pbc
```
Use `//` comments for JavaScript files.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Structure
* **Framework**: pytest with coverage reporting
* **Unit Tests**: `tests/` root directory
  - Fast, no external API calls
  - Use `fixtures/journal/` mock data
  - Test individual functions and modules
* **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` subdirectory
  - Test real backends (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
  - Require API keys in `.env`
  - Test end-to-end workflows
* **Naming**: Files `test_*.py`, functions `test_*`
* **Fixtures**: Shared fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests (fast)
make test                    # Quick run
make test-verbose           # With coverage details
make test-only TEST=path    # Specific test

# Integration tests (require API keys)
make test-integration
make test-integration-only TEST=name

# Coverage report
make coverage               # Generates htmlcov/index.html

# UI testing
convey-restart                # Restart Convey service (after code changes)
convey-screenshot <route>     # Capture Convey view screenshot (use -h for options)
```

**Important:** Always run `convey-restart` after editing anything in `convey/` or `apps/` to clear caches and reload code.

### Development Workflow
```bash
make format      # Auto-format code
make lint        # Check code quality
make test        # Run unit tests
make check-all   # Format, lint, and test (run before commit)
```

## Important Development Notes

### Environment Management
* **JOURNAL_PATH**: The live journal path is stored in `.env`. To access it:
  - **Shell/CLI**: Run `grep JOURNAL_PATH .env` to get the path, then use it directly
  - **Python CLI tools**: Call `setup_cli()` first, or manually use `load_dotenv()`
* **API Keys**: Store in `.env` file, never commit to repository
* **Entry Points**: Use command names (e.g., `think-indexer`) NOT `python -m ...`

### Error Handling & Logging
* Raise specific exceptions with clear messages
* Use logging module, not print statements
* Validate all external inputs (paths, user data)
* Fail fast with clear errors - avoid silent failures

### Documentation & References
* Update README files for new functionality
* Code comments explain "why" not "what"
* Function signatures should include type hints; highlight gaps when touching older modules
* **All docs in `docs/`**: JOURNAL.md, APPS.md, CORTEX.md, CALLOSUM.md, DOCTOR.md, etc.
* **App/UI work**: [docs/APPS.md](docs/APPS.md) is required reading before modifying `apps/`

---

## Dependencies Management

* **Minimize Dependencies**: Use standard library when possible
* **Production**: Add to `dependencies` in `pyproject.toml`
* **Development**: Add to `[project.optional-dependencies]` dev section
* **Installation**: `make install` (basic), `make dev` (with dev tools), `make full` (all optional)

---

## Development Principles

* **DRY, KISS, YAGNI**: Extract common logic, prefer simple solutions, don't over-engineer
* **Single Responsibility**: Functions/classes do one thing well
* **Conciseness & Maintainability**: Clear code over clever code
* **Security**: Never expose secrets, validate/sanitize all inputs
* **Performance**: Profile before optimizing
* **Git**: Small focused commits, descriptive branch names. Run git commands directly (not `git -C`) since you're already in the repo.
